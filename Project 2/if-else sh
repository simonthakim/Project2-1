//The purpose of this block is tho find whether num_a is small or not 
#!/bin/bash
   num_a=100
   num_b=200
   if [ $num_a -lt $num_b ]; then //compares both variables and sees if it yields true
   echo "$num_a is less than $num_b!"
   fi // closes if cond block

it can be intended like :

num_a=100
num_b=200
if [ $num_a -lt $num_b ];

then
echo "$num_a is less than $num_b!"
fi
